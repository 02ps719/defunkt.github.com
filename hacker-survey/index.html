First, let me say you are an amazing group of people.  When I conceived this idea to 'crowdsource' my data collection homework, I thought I might get a few hundred surveys at most, and it would be an interesting social experiment.  I had hoped (and I suppose I was correct in assuming) that the community would step up on this and keep people taking the survey out of their own academic interest.  The original story was submitted at around 9:30 eastern, and within the hour I spent in my calculus class rocketed to the top of Hacker News where it stayed pretty much all day.  My assumption is that people were continually upvoting the story in hopes of getting as many people to take the survey as possible.  It appears to have worked, since as of right now I'm looking at over two THOUSAND surveys collected in about 26 hours.  Even more impressive, a quick sanity-scan on the data suggests that only a few entries were created 'for the lulz.'  Overall, I'm very impressed with the turnout, and extremely happy with how this worked out.

While many of you happily took the survey, a few people also pointed out some flaws in the survey, and I'd like to address those briefly.  The two most prominent complaints were that there was no option for 'Academia' in the employment field, and that there was no 'country' field to give a reference for salary (since what one can live off in some countries might be considered meager in America).  Both are excellent clarifications, and had I been able to I would have loved to add them, but alas, it's hard to turn something like this around, and it would have cost a fair bit of data to add those afterword, so I opted to leave them out.  If someone were to do this again, I imagine these would be points of data that might be interesting, and I encourage whoever decides to do similar to take that in to consideration.

Thanks once again for all of your help, and I hope that people using this data will produce some interesting statistics for everyone to see.  If you do create something cool, please send me an email (dave at [this web site]) and I'll add a link to it on this page.  It's not required, but I'd love it if you would link to me in your article as well.

Thanks,
